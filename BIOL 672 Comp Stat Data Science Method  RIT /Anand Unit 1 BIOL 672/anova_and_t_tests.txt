The one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test were conducted to assess whether there were significant differences
in the means of the three groups (Group1, Group2, Group3). Based on the ANOVA and non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis,
we found that there are significant differences between the groups. Pairwise t-tests were conducted for each group
combination, and multiple testing corrections were applied using both Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg methods.

Correlation tests were conducted between Group1 and Group2. The Pearson correlation test revealed the linear relationship
between the two groups, while the Spearman correlation test captured any monotonic relationships. Both scatterplots were generated
to visualize these correlations, with the Pearson scatterplot showing a linear fit and the Spearman scatterplot showing a smoother
relationship between the variables.

A one-sample KS test was conducted to test the assumption of normality for Group1. The results suggest that the
data may not be normally distributed, as indicated by a p-value greater than 0.05 in the KS test.

The Q-Q plot for Group1 was generated to visually assess the normality of the data. In a Q-Q plot, if the data points lie
close to the reference line, it suggests that the data is approximately normally distributed. In our case, deviations from the
reference line suggest that the data in Group1 may not follow a normal distribution. This supports the need for non-parametric
tests like the Kruskal-Wallis test in cases where normality cannot be assumed.

Additionally, the empirical CDF of Group1 was compared to the theoretical CDF of a normal distribution. Significant deviations between
the two curves further suggest that the data in Group1 is not normally distributed.
