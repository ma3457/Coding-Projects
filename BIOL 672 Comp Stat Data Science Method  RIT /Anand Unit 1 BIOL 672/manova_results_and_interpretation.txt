Interpretation:
The MANOVA test was conducted to evaluate whether there are significant differences in the multivariate means of the variables
Length, Width, Height, Mass, and Density across the three groups (A, B, and C). The null hypothesis of the MANOVA test is that the
mean vectors of the dependent variables are equal across all levels of the independent variable (Group).

If the MANOVA test is significant (i.e., low p-value), it indicates that the group means differ significantly for at least one of the variables.
You can follow up with univariate ANOVAs or other post-hoc tests to determine which variables contribute to the group differences.
