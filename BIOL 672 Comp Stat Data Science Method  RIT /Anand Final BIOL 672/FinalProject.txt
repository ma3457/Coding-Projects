For this final project please submit a Figure (data visualization) suitable for publication that depicts an interesting aspect of your data.&nbsp; The data set and the aspect you visualize can be of your own choosing.&nbsp; I encourage you to use your Graduate Thesis data if you have it. If you don't yet have data you can use a dummy data set (i.e. randomly generated)&nbsp; and prepare your R/python code so that you can use it again on real data in the future.&nbsp; Make sure to write a complete figure caption. This is defined as a caption that fully explains to the reader what they are viewing without the need to go to any additional text in a document. For computer-based graphics, I recommend using ggplot2 in R or in python you may use plotnine, matplotlib, or seaborn.&nbsp; If you want additional challenge, you might explore interactive graphics like you would use on a webpage or dashbord app.&nbsp; Some tools for this are yellowbrick, plotly, plotly.js, and d3.js.&nbsp; There may be some others of which I am unaware.&nbsp; Submit both you code and the input and output files it may require.&nbsp; This will be due on the day of the final exam (12/16 at noon).
