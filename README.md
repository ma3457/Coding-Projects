Coding Projects Repository
This repository contains coding projects from multiple courses Iâ€™ve taken over the years. It includes work from computer science and bioinformatics-related classes, covering a range of topics such as scripting, data analysis, and computational biology.
Each project is organized by course and includes relevant scripts, documentation, and datasets. This repository serves as both a personal archive and a showcase of my coding experience.
