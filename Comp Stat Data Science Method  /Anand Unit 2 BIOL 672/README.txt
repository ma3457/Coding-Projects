README: Instructions to Run the AnandMA_unit2_BIOL672.py Script
Important Notes:
    TensorFlow Dependency: The script requires Python 3.11 for TensorFlow compatibility. Do not us Python 3.13 it will not run.
    Required Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and tensorflow. Ensure these libraries are installed in Python 3.11.
    Dataset: data.csv file is attached

Steps to installing Python 3.11:
    Install Homebrew (if not already installed) by running the following command in the terminal:
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    After installation, add Homebrew to your PATH by running:
        echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
        eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
    Install Python 3.11 using Homebrew:
        brew install python@3.11
    Verify the installation by checking the version:
        /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 --version
    Install the required libraries for the script using Python 3.11's pip:
        /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 -m pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow

Run the script using Python 3.11:
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 "/Users/maya.anand/Desktop/Anand Comp Stat BIOL 672/Anand Unit 2 Coding BIOL 672/AnandMA_unit2_BIOL672.py"
