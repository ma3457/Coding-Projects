The linear regression was conducted to model the relationship between Group1 and Group2 values. The regression equation is of the form:
Group2 = beta0 + beta1 * Group1, where beta0 is the intercept and beta1 is the slope.
The summary output of the regression provides the estimates for these parameters. The slope indicates how much change in Group2 is associated
with a one-unit increase in Group1. A statistically significant p-value for the slope suggests that there is a linear relationship between Group1 and Group2.

When to use regression vs. correlation:
Regression is used when you want to predict one variable (dependent variable) from another (independent variable), or when the goal is to model
the relationship between variables. Correlation is used to measure the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables without
the intention of making predictions. In this case, both correlation and regression suggest a linear relationship, but regression provides a predictive
equation with parameter estimates (slope and intercept).
